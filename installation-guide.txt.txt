### 3️⃣ Import the `.OVA` File

1. Open **VirtualBox**
2. Click **File → Import Appliance**
3. Browse and select the `.ova` file
4. Click **Next**
5. Review settings (adjust RAM or CPU if needed)
6. Click **Import**

> 💡 This step may take a few minutes depending on the file size.

### 4️⃣ Start the Virtual Machine

- Once imported, you’ll see the new VM listed in VirtualBox
- Click **Start** to launch the virtual machine
- The machine will boot into the pre-configured ethical hacking environment

### 5️⃣ Test Your Setup

- Log in using the default credentials (usually provided in the course material)
- Check network connectivity (NAT or Bridged Adapter)
- Launch tools like Kali Linux terminal, Wireshark, or Burp Suite (based on what’s included)

## 🧪 Optional: Configure Network for Practice Labs

- You can create an **internal network** or use **host-only adapter** to simulate attacks without Internet exposure
- Optionally add other VMs (e.g., Metasploitable2, DVWA) for penetration testing practice

---

## ✅ Success!

You now have a fully functional ethical hacking lab running from a `.ova` file using VirtualBox. This lab environment supports safe, hands-on learning of tools and techniques covered in the Cisco CEH course.
